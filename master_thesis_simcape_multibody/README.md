The code presented contains a simulation of my master thesis in MATLAB, Simulink and Simscape Multibody, with the latter which is suitable for modelling deformable objects. It can be run on MATLAB 2018b or later and some extra MATLAB toolboxes are needed, nevertheless the missing ones are shown by MATLAB and they can be easily added by means of the add-on MATLAB manager.


run robot_setup.m to calibrate and then align and bend the flexible object.
